FMA, otherwise a financial management application.

This console application is designed to help you manage your budget,
visualize your expenses with a chart.
It gives you the ability to create budgets, edit budget, delete budget, update them and visualize our expenses using a chart.
In addition, it gives you the option to save our data as a pdf/csv file.

To write this application I used:
-matplotlib
-panda
-csv
-reportlab
